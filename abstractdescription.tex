\section*{What do we have to do}
In the project we will learn the skills to design and implement a website.\\
Before we start we will discuss what skills do we bring to the group. Based on this we could make rough estimations on who will do what and share the workload.\\ 
In the fist phase we are going to cooperate and create a clear and user-friendly design for the website.\\
For this we plan to use a graph and layouts to visualize and make sure that the design we have is good. This will also give a clear goal for the team.\\
During the implementation phase our goals are learning and excercising the following skills:\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item GitHub, because improve efficiency for working toghether.
  \item HTML, CSS and JavaScript, for those not familiar yet.
  \item Optional Framework, like Bootstrap.
\end{itemize}
