\section*{What do we have to do}
In the project we will learn the skills to design and implement a website.\\
Before we start we will discuss what skills do we bring to the group. Based on this we could make rough estimations on who will do what and share the workload.\\ 
In the first phase we are going to cooperate and create a clear and user-friendly design for the website.\\
To do this we plan to use a graph and layouts to visualize and make sure that the design we have is good. This will also give a clear goal for the team to work towards so we stay on the same line.\\
During the implementation phase our goals are learning and exercising the following skills:\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item GitHub, because improve efficiency for working toghether.
  \item HTML, CSS and JavaScript, for those not familiar yet.
  \item Optional Framework, like Bootstrap.
\end{itemize}
We will look at the study guide and add upon the list of improvements already given to us.\\
In the end we expect to have a better site including the design materials and most importantly a improved skillset.\\
